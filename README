# IPFS Metadata Scraper Service

This repository contains the code for a Golang-based microservice that fulfills the requirements of a coding challenge. The service is designed to scrape metadata from a provided list of IPFS URIs and store the data in an AWS database service, such as DynamoDB. Additionally, it exposes two RESTful API endpoints to retrieve the scraped data.

## This is a proposed Project Structure

The project is organized into the following structure:

```plaintext

├── go.mod                     # Go modules file (if using Go modules)
└── go.sum                     # Go modules checksum file (if using Go modules)
```

## Tasks

### Task 1: Metadata Scraper
The metadata scraper retrieves information from the provided list of IPFS CIDs and fetches details like image, description, and name.

### Task 2: AWS SDK Connection and Data Storage
The service connects to a DynamoDB (or RDS) instance in the us-east-1 (Virginia) region and stores the scraped data.

### Task 3: RESTful API
Two endpoints are exposed:
- GET /tokens: Fetches all data stored in the database.
- GET /tokens/<cid>: Fetches only the record for the individual IPFS CID.

### Task 4: Docker Containerization
The service is containerized using Docker, as defined in the Dockerfile.

## Building and Running

Detailed instructions for building and running the application can be added here.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a well-structured and modular approach to building a scalable and robust microservice. It adheres to best practices for security, error handling, and code cleanliness.
